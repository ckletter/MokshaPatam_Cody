| September 2 |  4-4:30pm   | I have been tackling this problem recursively so far. I decided to focus on the ladders (not thinking about snakes for now), where I am looping through each ladder and doing a recursive call with that ladder (going down that route) to see if it is the fastest way, keeping track of the number of rolls as I go. After I tried all the possible combinations of going up ladders, I will compare the rolls to see which way is fastest. After that, I will start to consider snakes as well. |
| Sept 2      | 4:30-5:00pm |   I think I am VERY VERY close. I think my algorithm is correct (ignoring snakes) in trying to determine the number of rolls. I am still using a recursive method that tries a certain ladder as well as a for loop to try each possible ladder. Unfortunately, my code is only returning one roll size number instead of a whole series of combinations (which we can then check the lowest number for our solution). I look forward to class where I can check my answer and revise my solution. |
| Sept 4      | 10:10:30pm  |                                                 I am now re-trying the problem with the graph theory algorithm with BFS we discussed in class. I started coding out the recursive BFS method, adding the 1,2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 rolls to the queue and then moving to the next one in the queue. I am also beginning to create an array "lookup table" in order to figure out if the square I roll to is the start of a snake or a ladder. This method Mr. Blick discussed with me and Liam in class. |
