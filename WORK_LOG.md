| September 2 |    4-4:30pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I have been tackling this problem recursively so far. I decided to focus on the ladders (not thinking about snakes for now), where I am looping through each ladder and doing a recursive call with that ladder (going down that route) to see if it is the fastest way, keeping track of the number of rolls as I go. After I tried all the possible combinations of going up ladders, I will compare the rolls to see which way is fastest. After that, I will start to consider snakes as well. |
| Sept 2      |   4:30-5:00pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I think I am VERY VERY close. I think my algorithm is correct (ignoring snakes) in trying to determine the number of rolls. I am still using a recursive method that tries a certain ladder as well as a for loop to try each possible ladder. Unfortunately, my code is only returning one roll size number instead of a whole series of combinations (which we can then check the lowest number for our solution). I look forward to class where I can check my answer and revise my solution. |

I started coding out the recursive BFS method, adding the 1,2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 rolls to the queue and then moving to the next one in the queue. I am also beginning to create an array "lookup table" in order to figure out if the square I roll to is the start of a snake or a ladder. This method Mr. Blick discussed with me and Liam in class. |
| Sept 4      | 10:30am-11:00am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I continued coding out the BFS method, this time including an ArrayList alreadyExplored which keeps track of the nodes we've already added to the queue before, so that we don't re-search the same squares. I also finished my array "lookup table" in order to convert the square I would roll to to the end of a ladder or snake if necessary. I ran my "completed" code, but my solution was not correct, so I will now focus on debugging. |
| Sept 5      |   2:40-3:10pm   | I made a lot of breakthroughs during this session. Firstly, since we learned about runtimes and improving the efficiency of code in class, I learned that we could change the lookup times for not only snake/ladder starts but also squares that have been explored and number of rolls to O(1) efficiency using symbol maps. I was able to implement these and it drastically improved the speed of my code. Moreoever, I was able to fix bugs in my code and actually get it to achieve correctness by switching from a recursive approach to an iterative approach at Mr. Blick's recommendation. Finally, I was running into a small bug with the case where the snakes and ladders loop, but I was able to fix that by returning -1 outside of the while loop if the last square has not been reached. |
